## Introduction

In the era of this fast-paced society, people need to constantly develop themselves in many aspects of life, especially with the support of technology. Many applications such as [Fabulous](https://www.thefabulous.co/), [Habitify](https://www.habitify.me/), ... help us manage these things. However, this is a new field that can be exploited and further developed, so my team choose to research and implement an app which helps build good habits and motivate personal development, named SuperSelf - Self Development App. The product inherits the strengths of its predecessors, and incorporates a number of interesting features towards the maximum personal development of the user.

Not only a normal [scheduling application](#habit-tracker), where user can easily check as well as update theri progress any time, SuperSelf offers users a new and exciting feeling when playing as a character [joining in events](#events) and get highest rankings, collecting experience and [score with lively and intuitve statistic graphs](#stats). In addition, the application also has a classification of lots of suggested habits based on scientific recommendation, which are related to personal development (human communication, relationships, motivation, health, finance management, goal planning, knowledge and skills, spiritual strength ...).

We offer a bunch of utilities to help you effectively take and measure your actions, one of which is the [integrated running tracker](#running-tracker). Anything better than get on our shoes and go for a run everyday? This is one of the best habits to train, which makes every aspect of your life better. You will know your number of steps in a day or activate the running mode for a period of time, then get the results and know yourself better.

One more interesting feature is to connect people, in virtual events and even in the real space: you can [find others with simliar habits nearby](#find-friends) your area. At the same time users can [share short stories](#stories) about themselves (when they set goals, achieve success, ...) - everything is presented in the style of social-network like Facebook. In short, our aim is to [build a community](#community) of better selves. Let's join us to become the master of life.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

<details>
<summary>Click to read more</summary>
<br>
This project uses [node](http://nodejs.org) and [npm](https://npmjs.com). Go check them out if you don't have them locally installed.

Install Expo and get used to it - a very helpful tool for building universal React app, as it mentions in the [documentation](https://docs.expo.io/get-started/installation/).

```sh
$ npm install -g expo-cli
```

If you want to run the app directly before deploying in iOS or Android, [download Expo Client](https://expo.io/tools#client) on your phone.

Make sure you have downloaded the suitable version of Expo up to now. It should be Expo SDK >= 40.
</details>

## Development

### Progress

We are publishing this app to Google Store. After that, we will continue to develop more features.

### Suggestion
Some examples of functions to implement, these are plans of us
- Scale number of users while keeping the stability of the app
- Optimize memory and execution time of functions
- Message among users (like Messenger)
- Build web and sync among platform

- and many aspects to generate

- SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH:
	- Build a recommendation system based on user profile
	- Integrate AI for handling user interaction, calculate and generate remarks
	- Integrate data analysis to improve UX
	- Study algorithms for optimizing links in networks
	- Get data from application like Apple watch or Google Fit
