    text: "Self-motivation is, in its simplest form, the force that drives you to do things (Skills You Need, n.d.).  It’s the drive you have to work toward your goals, to put effort into self-development, and to achieve personal fulfillment.  It’s important to note here that self-motivation is generally driven by intrinsic motivation, a kind of motivation that comes from sincerely wanting to achieve and desiring the inherent rewards associated with it.  Self-motivation can also be driven by extrinsic motivation, the drive to achieve that comes from wanting the external rewards (like money, power, status, or recognition), although it’s clear that intrinsic motivation is usually a more effective and fulfilling drive.",

    text: "We know that staying active is one of the best ways to keep our bodies healthy. But did you know it can also improve your overall well-being and quality of life?   Here are just a few of the ways physical activity can help you feel better, look better and live better. Because, why not?  It’s a natural mood lifter. Regular physical activity can relieve stress, anxiety, depression and anger. You know that 'feel good sensation' you get after doing something physical? Think of it as a happy pill with no side effects! Most people notice they feel better over time as physical activity becomes a regular part of their lives. It keeps you physically fit and able. Without regular activity, your body slowly loses its strength, stamina and ability to function properly. It’s like the old saying: you don’t stop moving from growing old, you grow old from stopping moving. Exercise increases muscle strength, which in turn increases your ability to do other physical activities.   It helps keep the doctor away. Stand up when you eat your apple a day! Too much sitting and other sedentary activities can increase your risk of heart disease and stroke. One study showed that adults who watch more than 4 hours of television a day had an 80% higher risk of death from cardiovascular disease.",

    text: "Every relationship is unique, and people come together for many different reasons. Part of what defines a healthy relationship is sharing a common goal for exactly what you want the relationship to be and where you want it to go. And that’s something you’ll only know by talking deeply and honestly with your partner.  However, there are also some characteristics that most healthy relationships have in common. Knowing these basic principles can help keep your relationship meaningful, fulfilling and exciting whatever goals you’re working towards or challenges you’re facing together.  You maintain a meaningful emotional connection with each other. You each make the other feel loved and emotionally fulfilled. There’s a difference between being loved and feeling loved. When you feel loved, it makes you feel accepted and valued by your partner, like someone truly gets you. Some relationships get stuck in peaceful coexistence, but without the partners truly relating to each other emotionally. While the union may seem stable on the surface, a lack of ongoing involvement and emotional connection serves only to add distance between two people.  You’re not afraid of (respectful) disagreement. Some couples talk things out quietly, while others may raise their voices and passionately disagree. The key in a strong relationship, though, is not to be fearful of conflict. You need to feel safe to express things that bother you without fear of retaliation, and be able to resolve conflict without humiliation, degradation, or insisting on being right.  You keep outside relationships and interests alive.Despite the claims of romantic fiction or movies, no one person can meet all of your needs. In fact, expecting too much from your partner can put unhealthy pressure on a relationship. To stimulate and enrich your romantic relationship, it’s important to sustain your own identity outside of the relationship, preserve connections with family and friends, and maintain your hobbies and interests.",

    text: "The 2020 spending review included £2.9bn over three years for the Restart scheme, which promises “intensive and tailored support” to more than one million unemployed people. With further details still to be announced, it is crucial that thought is given to the significant challenges involved in providing careers support at such a large and unprecedented scale.  With many workers facing job losses as a result of the triple threat of Covid-19, automation and Brexit, the demand for careers advice is greater than ever. The success of the Restart scheme will depend, in large, on the quality of this advice. Job and training recommendations need to be based on data that reflects the range of shocks impacting the labour market today.  Advice must also be tailored to the needs and skills of the individual. The consequences of poorly tailored advice were seen in the recent resurfacing of a government-backed advertising campaign (from 2019) that encourages a ballerina (named ‘Fatima’) to give up her job and retrain in cyber security. The fiasco demonstrated how poor careers advice can linger and, in turn, undermine public confidence.",

    text: "By now, you probably know that a high credit score is better than a low one, but do you know all the reasons that’s true? A good FICO score and solid credit history can have a positive impact on many facets of your life. If you’re not there yet, don’t worry! You can improve your score over time by practicing responsible use of credit, including keeping your credit utilization low. Here are several benefits of good credit.  Maintaining a good credit score shows that you use credit responsibly. When banks or other lenders see this, it lets them know that you are a good credit risk and more likely to pay back the money you’re asking them to loan to you.  You know when you see those commercials offering 0% or extremely low financing? Those impressive rates are reserved for customers with equally impressive credit. If you want to keep your interest rates low, keep your credit score high. You’ll see more generous credit limits, too.  Apartments routinely check consumers’ credit for the same reason lenders do. They want to make sure that if they allow you to live there, you’re going to pay the rent in full, on time, every month. Your excellent credit offers them peace of mind that you are more likely to do that.  While prospective employers can’t view your credit score, they can see a version of your credit report that includes payment history. Employers look at it from a responsibility standpoint. They think if you use credit responsibly, pay your bills on time and aren’t overextended, you are probably more likely to be a responsible employee, too. On the other hand, bad credit can cause employers to hesitate during the hiring process.",
